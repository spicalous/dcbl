    If your thoughts were on a wedding gift...
  </div>
  <div class="mx-auto text-center mb-5" style="max-width: 320px;">
    <p>
      The most important thing is to have you with us on our special day.
    </p>
    <p>
      No gifts are needed or expected but in modesty, we would like to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do wish to give us something, a monetary gift towards our wishing well would be great.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the choice is really up to you, only if you wish to participate.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you prefer to purchase a gift, feel free to surprise us in your own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      We hope you come, enjoy yourselves and have a lovely day.
