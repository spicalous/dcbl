          The most important thing is to have you with us on our special day.
        </p>
        <p>
          No gifts are needed or expected but in modesty, we would like to say:
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do wish to give us something, a monetary gift towards our wishing well would be great.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the choice is really up to you, only if you wish to participate.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you prefer to purchase a gift, feel free to surprise us in your own way.
        </p>
        <p>
          We hope you come, enjoy yourselves and have a lovely day.
