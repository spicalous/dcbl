            We want to inform you that we have made the decision to postpone our wedding to <strong>Sunday 7 March 2021</strong>.
            Given the current circumstances, we don't feel as though we are able to have the wedding we want, whilst doing it
            safely and with everyone we want there with us.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you <strong>have already submitted your RSVP</strong> via our website, email, or whatsapp, please note that we
            will still take these into account but that they will apply for 7 March 2021, so if there is going to be a change in
            your attendance due to the change of date, please kindly resubmit your RSVP.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you <strong>have not yet submitted your RSVP</strong>, please kindly submit your RSVP to indicate your attendance
